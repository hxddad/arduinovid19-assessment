## ðŸ©º Overview

This project is a standalone COVID-19 self-assessment tool built using **Java** and an **Arduino Uno**. It combines a temperature sensor and a simple questionnaire to determine whether a user may have COVID-19. After the test, a text report is automatically generated on the user's computer confirming their result.
